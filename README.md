# supapet

supapet is a place for pet owners to post their pets pics and share with others.
You can like the posts and there is also a leader board to see who has the most likes.

This app is written with flutter, you can build locally by config your supabase info in the .env file and run `flutter run` in the root directory.

  .env file should be like this:

``` text
SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

## Thoughts

**It's proven again that supabase could be the pure only backend service to make an simple social media app, super excited to build more with supabase in the future.**
